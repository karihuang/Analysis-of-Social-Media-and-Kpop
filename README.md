# Analysis-of-Social-media-and-K-Pop
# INTRODUCTION
As the Internet improves connectivity around the world every day, there seems to be an endless amount of fresh art, film and other media in the world.

Thanks to the Internet, K Pop, an acronym for Korean popular music, was introduced to many countries and cultures around the globe. Anyone who has seen the ‘Gangnam Style' music video might think that they know a bit about K-Pop, but K-Pop is more than just this song.

According to Vox, South Korean artists have charted the Billboard Hot 100 at least eight times since the Wonder Girls first entered with their hit "Nobody", released in four different languages including English in 2009. Since then, K-pop exports have grown significantly, reaching $189.7 million only in music album exports in 2021.

Now that we know what and how influential K-Pop is, the next question would be: who are K-Pop audiences? Analyzing the characteristics of K pop fans, who are responsible for the enormous sales of the billion dollar industry, can help ad companies gain “deeper understanding of their current and potential customers to improve marketing strategy, customer experience, and brand perception”. Doing so can promote an increase in revenues and net profit for not only the Korean music companies, but also ad companies and social media apps such as Facebook.

In this tutorial, our goal is to guide the readers through the five stages of “Data Science Pipeline”: Data collection, Data management, Exploratory data analysis, Hypothesis testing, and Communication of insights attained. Which in our case will be collecting K-pop survey data gathered from social media, cleaning and tidying survey answers, performing demographic analysis of respondents vs money spent on K-pop, predicting how much money is spent given demographic characteristics, and finally conclude and discuss possible further exploration regarding different ways to explore the K-pop industry.
